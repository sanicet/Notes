Functional interfaces:
 An interface that contains only one abstract method. They can contain other default methods but only one abstract method is allowed. @FunctionalInterface is the optional annotation for compiler to know if the interface is functional.
 Comparable
 Runnable
 Callable
 java.util.function (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/function/package-summary.html) important ones
  Predicate<T>
  Consumer<T>
  Function<T,R>
  Note : generic parameters (for example, the T in Consumer<T>) can be bound only to reference types. So use above functional interface when you want to pass reference object and use 
  the primitive typed functional interface like IntPredicate when using primitive values. Else, there will be a performance impact when boxing and unboxing.
