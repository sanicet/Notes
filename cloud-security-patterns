Make a security checklist
 Data Protection
      PII/PCI Data?
      Where it is stored?
      internal or internet app?
      what sensitive tasks are performed in app?
     Does my app run any risky software activities?
 Identity Management 
    How does users verified?
    
  Data Protection pattern:
   Gatekeeper pattern
     Gatekeeper validates the request from client and pass it to host
     Gatekeeper role : Limited access and is exposed to public
     
  Identity Management 
         Valet key pattern
          user makes a request to app for a purticular request
          App validates the request and return the token
          Use the token to access the request
          the token is invalidated after some time.

        Federated Identity pattern
         Deligates authentication to external provider
   
       Use multi factor auhentication
       require re-authentication of some actions like financial
       consider jist in time access for requests
       use stable authN and authZ platform
       properly handling error and exceptions
       reduce attak surface. If you don't need it, delete it
       monitor your service and triggers about issues
       encrypt sensitive data
       implement fail safe measures
       consider threat modeling ( Stride threat modeling)
       Avoid hardcoding
        Spoofing attacks
         TLS         
        Tampering
         Monitoring
        Repudiation
        Information disclosure
         Encryption
        denail of service
         Monitoring and remediating
        elevation of previlage
         Authorization - federated identity providers
         
   Build a datalake
    Control plane audit logs ( cloud trail, audit logs etc)
    service specific logs ( storage access logs, kms access logs, function executions etc) - turn it on case by case basis based on importance and classification
    cloud-native detection services logs
    API gateway / WAF logs
    Network flow logs
    System logs from VMs
    End point detection and response agents in Vms
    application logs
    
   security objectives -  visibility, auditability, controllability, and agility
   How to assess security posture?
