HA resilancy notes
VPC
 AZ - Deploy the compute resources in atleast two AZ for resilancy
 Internet gateway - attached to vpc, highly available , redundent and horizontally scalbale
 VPC Peering connection - No underlying hardware, No bottleneck for scaling the traffic
 VPC End points - Similar to VPC Peering connection
 Virtual Private Gateway - Highly available but not redundent. There is two tunnels deployed in active passive mode in two different AZ.
                            At a time only one of them will be active. Route table should be configured to dynamically pull the routes incase of any failure with one tunnel. 
                            Resilancy will also depend on the complimentary connections and router ( dynamic or static) used in datacenter. The datacenter Customer Gateway should 
                            be configured with two tunnels.
 Nat Gateway - Highly available but blongs on one AZ. Best practice is to deploy different NAT Gateway for different Subnet and configure different routing tables for each subnet with corresponding gateway routes.
