Highly available - System will continue to function despite a failure to any of the components in the underlying achitecture
Fault tolerant - Highly available with no degredation of performance.
Resilant - The power or ability of a material to return to its original form
Availability - Determined by the percentage of uptime (SLA in 9s) of a purticular resource.
Redundant - Mutiple resources performing same task
SLA can be found in - Well architected reliability whitepaper framework pages 54-58 / aws.amazon.com/<service>/sla
Route53 health check graph can give you your application's SLA


HA resilancy notes

Deploying a 3 tier Architecture for Highly available

Network ( VPC)

 AZ - Deploy the compute resources in atleast two AZ for resilancy
 Internet gateway - attached to vpc, highly available , redundent and horizontally scalbale
 VPC Peering connection - No underlying hardware, No bottleneck for scaling the traffic
 VPC End points - Similar to VPC Peering connection
 Virtual Private Gateway - Highly available but not redundent. There is two tunnels deployed in active passive mode in two different AZ.
                            At a time only one of them will be active. Route table should be configured to dynamically pull the routes incase of any failure with one tunnel. 
                            Resilancy will also depend on the complimentary connections and router ( dynamic or static) used in datacenter. The datacenter Customer Gateway should 
                            be configured with two tunnels.If there is a HW outage, it will cause short interuption of service.
 Nat Gateway - Highly available but blongs on one AZ. Best practice is to deploy different NAT Gateway for different Subnet and configure different routing tables for
               each subnet with corresponding gateway routes.There will be short interuption of service if underlying hardware of nat gateway goes off. AWS will replace it with new one.
               Note that Nat instance is deployed into EC2 and may not be a good idea when resilancy is a problem.
 
 
 Compute
 
 Elastic Load Balancers - Select eleastic load balancers to deploy into atleast two AZ.(99.99 Availabilty SLA)
 Auto Scaling - Like load balancing can deploy into multiple AZ. Service is  (99.99 Availabilty SLA) but indvidual compute SLA is 90% SLA. So stateful application will have inflight transaction 
                impact.
                
 Database
 RDS - RDS can be deployed into Multiple AZ but supports only single write end point only available in one zone. Multiple reads are supported. 99.95% uptime. This is where RDS Arrora comes in.
 
 RDS Arrora - Can be deployed into Multiple AZ , supports writes in all nodes while being consistant. Availlability is increased to 99.99% Uptime. 
            - Only support Mysql and Postgres with purticular versions.
            - Self healing, Auto scalable
  
 AWS Serverless Resilant Architecture
               
 DNS
 Route53 - This has 100% SLA with global scope. If it is down, Amazon will pay you.
 
 CDN
 CloudFront - This has 99.99% SLA with global scope.  
 
Storage:
 S3 - Bucket is regional but objects have to choosen to be anything other than one zone. 99.99% SLA

API Front end
API Gateway - Same as S3

Authentication and Authorization
Amazone Cognito - Regional , 99.99. Can be integrated with API Gateway for user authentication.

Compute functions
Lambda -Regional , 99.95% SLA

Database ( No SQL)
Dynamo DB - Regional, 99.99% SLA

Highly available / Fault tolarent section

Cache
ElasticCache - This is backed up by Ec2. Service is highly available but not fault tolerant or redundant.

Redshift - This is desined to be highly performance and is only in one AZ. So it is not HA.

RDS Multi AZ - If primary become degraded or patches, then AWS will failure to read only. But it is not fault tolarent. There will be a interuption in service.

S3 - Servlerless. All good.

DynamoDb - All good.

APIGateway - All Good.

CloudFront - All Good

Route53 - All good.
