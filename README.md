Working with Local repository

Task #1 initialize a git repository
git init 

Task #2 check the status of git repository
git status

Task #5 commit a staged change
git commit -m "added first commit"

SSL Certificate commands

To generate an RSA key, use the genrsa command:
openssl genrsa -aes128 -out fd.key 2048
 
To see the information in private key
openssl rsa -text -in private.key

If you need to have just the public part of a key separately, you can do that with the following rsa command:
$ openssl rsa -in fd.key -pubout -out fd-public.key

Generate a CSR with a new Private Key
openssl req -out <CSR>.csr -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout <unencrypted name>.key
 
Generate a CSR with an existing private Key
openssl req -new -key private.key -out fd.csr

check that the CSR is correct
openssl req -text -in fd.csr -noout

Creating CSRs from Existing Certificates
openssl x509 -x509toreq -in fd.crt -out fd.csr -signkey fd.key

Signing a CSR to generate self-signed certificate
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in fd.csr -signkey fd.key -out fd.crt

Examining certificate
openssl x509 -text -in fd.crt -noout

PKCS#12- A complex format that can store and protect a server key along with an entire certificate chain. Itâ€™s commonly seen with .p12 and .pfx extensions.

convert the key and certificates in PEM format to PKCS#12
openssl pkcs12 -export \
    -name "My Certificate" \
    -out fd.p12 \
    -inkey fd.key \
    -in fd.crt \
    -certfile fd-chain.crt
Enter Export Password: ****************
Verifying - Enter Export Password: ****************

command for  PKSC#12 to extract detail

openssl pkcs12 -in fd.p12 -out fd.pem -nodes

Linux
 Find

   eg ; find /etc -type f | xargs grep -l -i "damian"


 to increase the time out:

 Resolution
   Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file
   Un-remark or add the ClientAliveInterval parameter and set it to the number of seconds (of inacitivty) that ssh should wait before     terminating the connection.
   Un-remark or add the ClientAliveCountMax and set it to 0.
   Restart the ssh daemon.
   Additional Information
   An example configuration would be:

   ClientAliveInterval 600
   ClientAliveCountMax 0

   This would clear any ssh sessions that have been inactive for 10 minutes.

Getting size of the table
  
select owner, segment_name, sum(bytes)/1024/1024 MB from dba_segments where segment_name in ('table name');

select owner, segment_name, sum(bytes)/1024/1024  MB from dba_segments where segment_name in (select index_name from dba_indexes where table_name='table name')

Coverting Blob to clob

JPA

Spring:
I prefer using constructor injection (over field and setter injection) to keep the state in my components immutable. The immutable state is important if you want to be able to run the component in a multithreaded runtime environment.

Prefer having the instance variable declared as final if it need to not be changed

Annotations : @SpringBootApplication, @Component, @Bean (used in java configuration), @Configuration, @AutoWired ( injecting a component to another instance variable, @ComponentScan({"package"}), @RestController , @GetMapping(value="/my-resource", produces="application/json"), @PostMapping(value="",produces="")

Spring Webflux : Supports annotation based style or functional style (based on routers and handlers). Instead of RestTemplate, it uses WebClient for http request, It supports servlet based containers but need servlet 3.1 or higher. Or we will have to use embodded non servlet based containers eg Netty

Spring boot property names : application.properties or application.yml
  Change the port eg : server.port:8081


SpringFox is used to document the service based and is based on Swagger /open API specification. it does this by examining tha application while startup to create documents based on inspecting various annnotations eg: webflux, swagger etc


Spring Data - Based on entities and repositories , It supports relational( JPA based) and non relational ( eg : Mongo - document, key-value - Redis, Graph -Neo4j). Annotations - @Entity, @IDClass("idclass.class"), @Table("tableName"), @ID, @Version
Entity - Data to be stored;
Repository -interface used to store and retrieve data from tables in a generic way.
eg :
public interface ReviewRepository extends CrudRepository<ReviewEntity, ReviewEntityPK> {
    Collection<ReviewEntity> findByProductId(int productId);
}
Spring Data will implement the method if naming convention is followed properly.
 
For reactive, use ReactiveCrudRepository - returns Mono(0-1) or Flux(0-m) streams as they are available. Spring data JPA does not support this but spring data MongoDB supports this.
